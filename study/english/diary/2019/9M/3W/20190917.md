## Story

Today, I'm got up at 8am. It makes me comfortable to take public transportation. That is going to Seoul from Incheon at 7~9 o'clock is hell. I want to avoid this time.

A little unfortunately, Bus driver is not kind. He told with someone throught phone and then cuss other drivers. It is so not plesant. Anyway,  I arrived in work conveniently than other day.

I had a lunch in china restaurant. I choose the Fried 짬뽕. It is so salty and spicy. I often get smear with soup on my clothes, Despite wearing an apron. Today so do.

I heard that our product deadline 앞당겨지다(advanced??) about 2 weeks. I have a plan to take vacation. It is so getting a difficult...:(

After work, I met my girl friend. we ate the brooklin burger. and then we shopped in KOEX. We bought some clothes. we talked that something we do and some troubles. We didn't have many time, I took her home to talk more.

It is too late to go my home, I went my friend's home. I recorded my day and fall asleep.
