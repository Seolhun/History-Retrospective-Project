# The Journey

The story arc of this book covers a full career in software development, condensed down into a quick read that is meant to be accessible to all practicing developers.

## Chapter 1

You are a competent programmer, and you are putting your skills to good use by helping people explore new product ideas through rapid prototyping.

## Chapter 2

Your work becomes more complicated. You need to incrementally grow existing systems and you have many active customers to support. There’s a feeling of conflict between what you think is the right way to work, and the pressure around you to ship new features quickly.

## Chapter 3

You gain a deeper understanding of the costs of rushed decision making, especially at the integration points between your own code and the outside world. You’ve learned a great deal from past mistakes, and have started to focus on the com‐ plex relationships between business, customer service, and technical work.

## Chapter 4

You are now a highly experienced developer. You are capable of helping others understand how to think about programming and problem solving, and have started to mentor a friend who is new to the field.

## Chapter 5

You’ve become an effective teacher, and your development experience is strong enough that you’re able to think on your feet, even in the context of live dem‐ onstrations. You use these skills to help students bridge the gap between theory and practice in a classroom setting.

## Chapter 6

You are starting to progress down the path to mastery. You’re able to pin‐ point the weak spots of legacy software systems and design proper replacements for them, optimizing for both business outcomes and human-friendly workflows.

## Chapter 7

You now have enough familiarity with the whole business of software that you’re capable of working within an organization to identify and fix problems at every level. Your core competency is still in software development, but you’ve gained enough experience to communicate well at many levels.

## Chapter 8

You start to wonder about the future of the computing industry as a whole. At this point, you’re free to pick your own career path, so figuring out where you’re going and why starts to be the most important question.
Because the career of a software developer is more like a spiral than a line, I encourage you to read through all of these chapters, no matter what your current skill level is.
I’ve written these stories to work at many levels, and there’s no dividing line between the “basic” and “advanced” topics in this book. Each chapter is self-contained, so jumping around is alright...but for best results, read from cover to cover.
