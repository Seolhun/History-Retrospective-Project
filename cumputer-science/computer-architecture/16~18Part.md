# Data Hazards(16 ~ 17Part)

## Forwarding vs Stalling

#### Stalling

Using bubble to exec lazy.

- nop == no operation == buble

Stalling is so difficult to calculate memory and validation.

#### Forwarding

2. Branch prediction
3. Delayed branch

## Stall on branch

Wait until branch outcome determined before fetching next instruction

## Branch prediction

#### Static branch prediction

- predicts before a programs runs
- using either compile time heuristics or profiling

#### Dynamic branch prediction

- Prediction of branches at runtime using run time information
- Look up the address of the instruction to see if a branch was taken the last time this instruction was executed
- If so, to begin fetching new instructions from the same place as the last time

## Delayed branch

#### Delayed branch

- Always executes the next sequential instruction,
  with the branch taking place after that one instruction delay

#### Branch delay slot

- The slot directly after a delayed branch instruction
- Filled by a safe instruction
