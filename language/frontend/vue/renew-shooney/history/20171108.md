2. Routing Blog and Detail

## Trouble Shooting.
#### 1. Markdown Css import
##### - Problem
	1. I used [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css), and if you use 'Vue.use or import this in main.js', It is not good. because you can't customize this when you want.

##### - Solution
	1. I get this css code from the dist directory, and pasted into my scss file when I need to use this on my mind.
	2. I recommend that you just use "@import 'src/path'~". very simple. you can customize the css When you want.

#### 2. Routing Configuration Error
##### - Problem
	1. Blog have the routing children about 'BlogDetail, BlogEditor...'. 
	2. But, Blog call ItemList in ItemList Componenet from another *.vue. Because of reusing anywhere.
	3. **Not working children routing and printed erorr.**. 
	- The reason why ItemList Component is not in Blog. So not working children route information on the Blog. Re-write route.js information.
	

##### - Solution
	1. ** Important thing is componenet relation. **
	- If you don't use componenet on parents componenets. Write a route information this outer like this.
	```JSON
    {
      path: '/blog',
      name: 'Blog',
      component: Blog,
      children: [
      ],
      beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {
        console.log('Routing in Blog')
        next()
      }
    },
    {
      path: '/blog/:nickname/:idx',
      name: 'BlogDetail',
      component: BlogDetail,
      beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {
        console.log('Routing in BlogDetail')
        next()
      }
    }
    ```
