### Two reading clubs

We made reading clubs with previous company colleages. The club name is DDA.DDO.HAM, 
In paraphrase, This means Splitting and Together. We plan sharing and meeting rules.
One. Do All things asynchronous online
Two.  Reading two books per month and two chapter per week. And share them to comment each others frankly and comfortably.
Three. We meet offline once per month to discuss and share something interested and trendy tech.
I think we all have similar jobs and interesting. So the clubs is so good so far :)
The other club is my company club. This is not getting started yet because someone move and make clubs like game and movie anythings. I think it is really good movements to grow and make good energy for all together :)
Anyway, we will start this club this week. I suggest and we select Thinking about thought book'. I expect read this soon :)


### Excersise is not anymore first to me

I try to up muscle and down weight then before. I spent about 4~50 minutes doing this.
When I was young, Spend much times about 2 hours everyday. But now, I don't need to muscle to work and spending much times is so not good choices.
